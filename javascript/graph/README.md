# Graphs
Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

## Challenge
* Node can be successfully added to the graph
* An edge can be successfully added to the graph
* A collection of all nodes can be properly retrieved from the graph
* All appropriate neighbors can be retrieved from the graph
* Neighbors are returned with the weight between nodes included
* The proper size is returned, representing the number of nodes in the graph
* A graph with only one node and edge can be properly returned
* An empty graph properly returns null

## Approach & Efficiency
I just follow the tasks that I'm going to do for the lectures & assignments.

## API
* Time O(1)
* Space O(1)
