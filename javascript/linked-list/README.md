# Singly Linked List
The topic of this challenge is based on the linked list which is based on implementing nodes to certain point where you can find values & move on to the next node.

## Challenge
The main purpose of this challenge is to implement certain js files as well as testing units to make sure that if one node is not null, it moves to the next one & it goes on like this until a node is null or has no value.

1- Creating a Node js file which has the properties for storing the values of the current nodes & then moves on to the next node
2- Creating a linked list js file which has a class function which consists of 3 types of functions:
  * Insert function - It has the ability to add a new node in which the values are inserted with a big O performance
  * Include function - It has the ability to check the boolean value of the node to see if its true or false depending on the existance of the node values
  * Sting function - It has the ability to returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

## Approach & Efficiency
  * Insert function - I inserted a value or a number which actually has a 1 big O complexity
  * Include function - I inserted an IF-ELSE statement to ensure that the node values not only exist in their nodes, but also ensuring the fact that's true or false


## API
  * Insert function - It adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
  * Include function - It indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
  * Sting function - It has the ability to returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
